<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://larrys-code.github.io/Library-Project/)

This project was built after several lessons on linting, **Objects** and **constructors**. As such this project was a review in applying those concepts.

This is the first project in which I used **Prettier** and **ESLint**, following the [AirBnB Style Guide](), in an effort to produce more maintainable code.

### Built With

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

Each book object is displayed with their information and a marker to indicate whether the user has read the book or not; this can be toggled by clicking on each book's respective card.

Extra books can be added with the "+" button, and they can each be removed with an "x" button that appears upon hovering each card.

## Development and Future Optimizations

- :green_circle: Adding books
- :green_circle: Deleting Books
- :large_orange_diamond: Refactored, readable code

As this was my first forray into Objects with JavaScript, my first pass at the code was very rough and completely tangled.

After learning more about **Factory Functions** I immediately revisited this project to make it more readable and maintainable. It still isn't perfect though, but I am happy with it as a first go at dealing with Objects in JS.

## Acknowledgments

* This project was completed as a part of [*"The Odin Project"*.](odin-url)
